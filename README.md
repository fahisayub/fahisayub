Iam an Aspiring Web Developer, always curious about new problems(i use to see it as an opportunities) and bringing the best solution with an interdisciplinary collaboration. I love to work with team, which brings me additional energy. Working with a great team is always a pleasure.


>As a simple human, over the past 6 years, I have been working towards improving my skills for executing my mission. I believe my mission is to enhance efficiency and thereby enhance lives on the planet. Wherever I am, whatever I do, I have a clear sense of why. which drives me ahead no matter how many times I fall, this leads me to acquire knowledge in engineering and acquiring skills, such as:
>> **React | Redux | Chakra-UI | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | CLI Bash | Flutter | Dart | Firebase | MIT app inventor | Arduino | Fusion360 | AutoCAD | SolidWorks | ANSYS | Adobe XD | Inkscape | Illustrator**

>that helps me to execute my mission.

>This gives me the confidence to have a solution for each problem that comes to me because having a wider perspective helps me to think creatively, and try new approaches to build new products and services that benefit the people around me. and I really enjoy building things whether it is hardware or software or service.

And I believe this journey will continue by exploring more, with the help of God for creating a better tomorrow and never having a plan to settle.
